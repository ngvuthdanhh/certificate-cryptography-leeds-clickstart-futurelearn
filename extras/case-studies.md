# Case Studies in Cryptography

## Case Study 1: DES Deprecation
- DES (Data Encryption Standard) widely used in the 1970sâ€“1990s.
- Vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to 56-bit key size.
- Replaced by AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

## Case Study 2: SHA-1 Collision
- In 2017, Google & CWI Amsterdam demonstrated the first practical SHA-1 collision.
- Proved SHA-1 insecure for digital signatures & certificates.
- Organizations migrated to SHA-256 or SHA-3.

## Case Study 3: TLS Vulnerabilities
- Protocols SSLv2/SSLv3 deprecated due to vulnerabilities (POODLE attack).
- TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 adopted for secure communication.
- Emphasized the importance of protocol updates.

## Case Study 4: RSA Key Mismanagement
- Incidents where private keys leaked compromised entire systems.
- Lesson: Secure key management (HSMs, KMS) is critical.
