# Attacks on Cryptography

## Brute Force
- Trying all possible keys until the correct one is found.
- Stronger key lengths â†’ more secure.

## Cryptanalysis
- Exploiting weaknesses in algorithms (e.g., DES broken by differential cryptanalysis).

## Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
- Attacker intercepts key exchange.
- Mitigation: Certificates, PKI.

## Replay Attack
- Re-sending captured messages.
- Mitigation: Nonces, timestamps.

## Weak Implementation
- Poor randomness, key reuse, padding oracle attacks.
