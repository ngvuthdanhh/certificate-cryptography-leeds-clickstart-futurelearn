# 03 â€“ Asymmetric Encryption

## Definition
Uses a **public key** for encryption and a **private key** for decryption.

## Key Algorithms
- RSA
- ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
- Diffie-Hellman (for key exchange)

## Advantages
- Solves key distribution problem
- Enables digital signatures

## Challenges
- Slower than symmetric
- Requires larger key sizes for strong security
