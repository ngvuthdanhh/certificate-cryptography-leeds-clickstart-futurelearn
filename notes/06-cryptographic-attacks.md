# 06 – Cryptographic Attacks

## Types of Attacks
- Brute Force – trying all possible keys
- Dictionary & Rainbow Table attacks – precomputed hashes
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
- Side-Channel Attacks – exploiting timing, power usage
- Weak Random Number Generators

## Defense Strategies
- Use strong algorithms (AES, RSA-2048+)
- Apply salts to hashes
- Enforce secure key exchange
