## Definition
Uses the same secret key for both encryption and decryption.

## Common Algorithms
- DES (outdated)
- AES (widely used)
- Blowfish / Twofish

## Strengths
- Fast, efficient for large data
- Simpler to implement

## Weaknesses
- Key distribution problem
- Does not scale well for large systems
