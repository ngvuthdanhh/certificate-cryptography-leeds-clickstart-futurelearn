# RSA Encryption Lab

## Objective
Learn how to generate RSA key pairs and perform encryption/decryption.

## Steps
1. Generate a 2048-bit RSA key pair.
2. Share the public key for encryption.
3. Encrypt a sample message with the public key.
4. Decrypt with the private key.

## Tools
- Python (`cryptography` or `rsa` library)
- OpenSSL

## Expected Outcome
Students understand public vs private key roles in RSA.
