# Digital Signature Lab

## Objective
Understand how digital signatures ensure authenticity.

## Steps
1. Generate a private-public key pair (RSA or ECDSA).
2. Sign a text message using the private key.
3. Verify the signature using the public key.
4. Try modifying the message and re-check signature verification.

## Tools
- Python `cryptography` library
- OpenSSL

## Expected Outcome
Students understand integrity + authenticity provided by signatures.
