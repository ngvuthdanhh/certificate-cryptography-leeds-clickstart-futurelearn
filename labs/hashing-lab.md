# Hashing Lab

## Objective
Practice generating and verifying message digests.

## Steps
1. Take a sample text file.
2. Generate its SHA-256 hash.
3. Modify the file slightly.
4. Generate the hash again.
5. Compare the two hashes.

## Tools
- Linux `sha256sum` command
- Python `hashlib`

## Expected Outcome
Students see how even small changes cause completely different hashes.
